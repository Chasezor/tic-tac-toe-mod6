**THE PLAN**
goal of this is to check to see if the game is working
make sure that player can place on every location
click on each of the movement options and see what happens 
click on the same players spots and see what happens 
win a game and see what happens
tie a game and see what happens 
lose a game and see what happens 

**Results***
When you win a game,
the game message is that you lose, 
this should clearly be a win

you can click on the other players spots 
and switch them to your own 

when you block the Path of the AI it bugs
out and place little o not Big O
Then the AI bugs out and stops playing 

Because of the bugg with the little o you 
can never get a tie removing the code fixes 
the issue leading to win

AI plays the same position every time 
got to move the AI start to a different location

Because it's the same pattern you can wins an easy win
the game needs to add better AI

also the order of players should switch off
